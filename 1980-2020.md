## 1980 to 2020: What happened after the Baby Boom slowed down? ##

**Value per acre failures in Topeka and elsewhere**

Downtown is our best prospect for economic growth
We have worsened our city’s economic outlook by spreading out our population into suburbs easily-accessed by city highways. This ever-expanding outline has created massive maintenance liabilities for our city budget without expanding our tax base. Topeka’s population has been the same for 50 years, but our square mileage has steadily increased in that same time. That’s more miles of streets, sewers, and water lines for the city to maintain, on functionally the same property tax revenue from decades ago. At the same time, we wrecked a high-performing district in downtown and gave up taxable land to non-taxable uses.

Urban Renewal became “Urban Removal,” sending thousands of residents out of the downtown district, and building a highway express route to the suburbs. Commercial properties have proliferated on the fringes of Topeka. We grew our city on the edges, rather from the middle, and we are financially suffering as a result.

If you’re curious to learn more about massive maintenance liabilities, the example of Lafayette, Louisiana may sound familiar. (https://www.strongtowns.org/journal/2017/1/9/the-real-reason-your-city-has-no-money) Lafayette is a city of 125,000 (about the same as Topeka) that would have to raise taxes by $3,300 per household today just to maintain the roads and drainage systems they have already built. We’re in the same situation. Topeka has a $60 million liability on water lines alone. (https://www.cjonline.com/news/20200307/city-seeks-to-replace-aging-pipes-without-soaking-taxpayers)

Instead of urban renewal, a better bet in the 1950s would have been to help residents of The Bottoms improve their properties, block by block. After all, poor neighborhoods make the best investments. (https://www.strongtowns.org/journal/2017/1/10/poor-neighborhoods-make-the-best-investment) The biggest gain in value for Topeka would have been to build and improve incrementally within The Bottoms district. Downtown creates some of the best property tax revenue in the city, with many parcels bringing in the highest value per acre compared to any other part of Topeka. (https://biketopeka.com/2020/05/20/value-per-acre-what-did-we-learn/) Sadly, incremental investment in The Bottoms neighborhood is not an option any more, but maybe we can still make good on the destruction that urban renewal caused.

As we look at KDOT’s plan to rebuild and expand the Polk-Quincy Viaduct section of Interstate 70, it’s time to pause and consider what happened when this highway was built. The highway project and the Keyway Urban Renewal Project pulled the plug on downtown Topeka and drained it of significant, valuable population and commerce. Now, we are desperate to add residents and businesses to the area, but it’s a slow project. Maybe there’s a better way.

Those who forget the past are condemned to repeat it

The real problem is right in front of us, and it’s not the noisy, polluting highway. That’s just a nuisance. The real problems are the silent struggles of our neighbors and residents who live within reach of the most valuable real estate district in all of Shawnee County, but don’t have enough food to eat, don’t have stable employment, and don’t have access to the power needed to make change in the future of their city — all because we cut apart communities of color in the 1950s.

These wounds will never be fully healed; we will never have the community like we might have had. But the pain and damage can be acknowledged, and we can work to give today’s generations a better start. We need to do that with real, physical acknowledgement — with money and land for economic development.

Because The Bottoms was the most affordable place to live in Topeka, many families had nowhere to go when urban renewal started. The Topeka Housing Authority was founded, and the Pine Ridge housing project was built. In its first year, it had 300 applications for just 100 apartments. We took a housing challenge from one part of the city and moved it to another area.

In 2016, black families nationally had on average 1/10th the wealth of white families. That is not to say that white families are necessarily wealthy — just that black families have significantly more barriers to education, employment, healthcare, and homeownership. Black families have been left behind, because they were legally prohibited from securing loans to buy homes in the 1940s and 1950s. At the same time, white families were investing in property and land, most of which appreciated significantly in the last five decades. Furthermore, in Topeka, the unemployment rate for black men in 2018 was 12.9% and only 5% for white men. (https://www.brookings.edu/blog/up-front/2020/02/27/examining-the-black-white-wealth-gap/) and (https://www.khi.org/assets/uploads/news/14815/ib1807_socio_final.pdf)

Despite a promising start as a free state, and a sort of ‘utopia’ for black families fleeing continued harassment after the Civil War, Kansas has not delivered on the promise of equality that our Constitution guarantees. From the late 1800s to the 1950s — a span of about 70 years — black families built community, built businesses, and built their families in Topeka. But the Keyway Urban Renewal Project, in about four years, shattered that dream for thousands of people. The racist policymaking of redlining, urban renewal, and urban highways exacerbated inequalities in Topeka, and ensured that our downtown would be less diverse in the future than it was at the turn of the 20th century.

Right now, we have the chance to do something different than KDOT’s proposed plan for rebuilding the Polk-Quincy Viaduct. We don’t have to add lanes (and add traffic) and bulldoze more buildings to keep our city on track for progress. We can tear down the highway and route traffic on boulevards instead. Streets like 10th Street, 8th Street, 6th Street, and Topeka Boulevard are all designed to carry plenty of traffic. If you’re just passing through, Google Maps reports that I-470 is only a minute different from using I-70. We can fill in the hole left by the below-grade highway downtown, and resurrect land where it used to be. We can offer that land, and capital, to former residents of the area, and any current resident of Topeka Housing Authority who writes a business plan.

**One city’s path to rebuilding downtown**

Topeka is far from the first city to consider closing part of an interstate. Take a look at the Inner Loop East project in Rochester, NY. (https://rbj.net/2019/09/18/inner-loop-projects-beginning-to-take-shape/)

Rochester closed a section of below-grade highway, filled in the hole, and developed new construction on top of that land.

Instead of rebuilding the highway, they closed it and filled it in with dirt, and the Mayor led the charge to encourage new development. The city saved millions of dollars in maintenance. And now, more than $200 million has been spent in private investment for housing and retail. In the near future, Rochester will be earning new property tax on land that has been un-taxable for decades.

The rebuild of the Polk-Quincy Viaduct is expected to cost more than $300 million to complete, mostly federal and state funding, with $20 million coming from Topeka (all debt). But if we close the highway, how much will we save? How much will we gain? It makes sense that Topeka should invest in land, especially its most valuable downtown land. After all, they’re not making any more of it.


**What else happened after the Baby Boom slowed down**

First, we built the suburbs. 
Then, we built highways leading to those suburbs.
Then, we built malls in the suburbs, and drained downtown of retail.
Then, we built roads from suburb to suburb, and put strip-malls in between them. 
Then we had to build schools and fire stations and parks in the suburbs. 
Pretty soon, we were spending just as much of the city's taxpayer money on sprawl as we were on the original town. 

Suburban development is an inefficient method for a city to disperse its tax dollars. With wider roads, bigger land parcels, and neighborhoods far away from existing infrastructure - it costs more and more for a city to maintain these areas. 

Old neighborhoods near downtown tend to be more compact and more efficient for a city to fund. The infrastructure is smaller. The streets are narrower and require less paving. The sidewalks already exist, so there aren't costly design phases to build new sidewalks. 

Right now, Topeka is like many other cities in the U.S. - a doughnut. Much of the city's wealth, especially residential wealth, is concentrated in neighborhoods that ring around the fringe of the city. In the middle of the city - downtown and its immediate surrounding neighborhoods - is the hole. Disinvestment, displacement, and vacancy are the rule. Retail and office buildings constructed of brick and stone sit vacant while new commercial development made with sheet metal are being built every season on the edge of town. Why should buildings, intended to last 100 years, sit vacant, while new buildings, built to last no more than 15-20 years, see full occupancy? In Topeka alone, we love to rebuild our fast-food restaurants. Typically we build a new one right next to the old one. You can see this pattern with Pizza Huts, Taco Bells, McDonald's restaurants, and more. The city's forebears put real investments into bank buildings, office buildings, and towers downtown - investing hundreds of thousands, sometimes millions - in sturdy buildings meant to last for generations. But we don't build this way any more. We build cheap and fast because our economy has become based on short-term growth -- not longevity.

"..the Suburban Experiment is not a problem we can solve, but a predicament with outcomes we can only manage."
https://www.strongtowns.org/journal/2018/4/16/where-did-the-money-go


**Kansas City example from Strong Towns:**

"Kansas City in 1946 had approximately 12 feet of street for each of its 434,000 residents. Then the city began a massive annexation binge, gobbling up suburban and rural land even as the population of the core city plummeted amid postwar decline and white flight. Core neighborhoods saw whole swaths of land demolished for new highways to serve suburban commuters.

By 2018, Kansas City had added an additional 58,000 net new residents while more than quintupling its physical area. For each of those new residents, on average, Kansas City built a jaw-dropping 148 feet of new streets: over 12 times the per-capita street obligation of its prewar pattern. In total, the city added 1,625 miles of streets and roads in the post-war era, a 169% expansion of its street network to accompany only a 13% increase in population.

These statistics illustrate how the Suburban Experiment was a pivot point in the history of North American cities, a moment at which we started doing something fundamentally different and unprecedented. It's an experiment we've never been able to afford—though only nowadays, as much of our 20th-century infrastructure begins to need repair or replacement, are the bills coming due in an obvious way. And Kansas City exemplifies that as well as anywhere."

**Local thoughts on Kansas City**

Getting to Kansas City from Topeka takes about an hour by car. Crossing the greater Kansas City metro area from say, Olathe, KS to Liberty, MO, also takes about an hour by car. Kansas City is huge. With the exception of downtown and some prewar neighborhoods, it's a massive nest of suburbs connected by highways - and very little practical infrastructure.

**Personal story about Kansas City - include anecdotes about mother's upbringing? And a note about shopping malls**

As a kid, making a trip to Kansas City usually meant going to Oak Park Mall in Overland Park. 

Checking the map for the Oak Park Mall area today, the mall is surrounded by modern chain-based retail and restaurants. Three of the 30+ businesses surrounding the mall are local; the rest are national chains. The intersection of 95th & Quivira is on par with Kansas City-style development: it's huge. Built like a divided highway that would be better suited for crossing rural farmland, these streets have eight lanes crossing eight lanes. Sidewalks are present, but only used when absolutely necessary. I've been visiting Oak Park Mall for 20 years and have never had occasion to use the sidewalks in the area. The car-based infrastructure in this area is not exactly convenient - requiring short car trips to leave the mall and go eat at Bo Ling's restaurant across Quivira Road. From JC Penney inside the mall to the front door of Bo Ling's is about 600 feet in a straight line, or a few minutes' walk. But crossing 8 lanes of 45 mph traffic is a bad idea for a pedestrian. Using the built-in pedestrian infrastructure and crossing the street at the stoplight almost triples the walking journey. So, driving across the street is the best option. This is not convenience. Our car-based built environment has spread things out, and made life more expensive and more difficult. Humans have a natural capacity for extremely efficient bipedal locomotion - walking - but in this case, the easiest and safest option for crossing a distance of 600 feet is getting inside a 3,000-pound metal machine, starting its engine capable of propelling that machine to speeds of 80 mph, crossing traffic where hundreds of other people inside metal machines are competing for space, and driving for two minutes to get to the restaurant.

**Climate Change**

Is climate change the new poor people's campaign? 
Probably not. The poor people's campaign encompasses more than that. But it's certainly one big issue.
But like every natural disaster and man-made challenge, it tends to affect the poor disproportionately. 
Take the novel coronavirus COVID-19, a climate-change related pandemic. In the U.S., the virus has disproportionately affected people of color and people experiencing poverty. ( https://now.tufts.edu/articles/why-people-color-are-suffering-more-covid-19 ) 

In Kansas, we don't often discuss climate change. But we do talk about droughts, floods, and storms, which all affect the state's biggest industry, agriculture. 


**Urban-Rural**

About 99% of Kansas is farmland. We are a very rural state. We have a population of almost 3 million people, and we are not densely populated - we average about 35 people per square mile. We're in the top ten of rural states in the country. Despite our rural roots, more than two-thirds of Kansans live in cities and urban areas. Half of the state's urban population lives in Johnson County alone. 

Kansas was once even more rural than it is today, but as rural opportunities fade away, interest in urban living increases. 

And yet, urban living in Kansas doesn't mean living in high-rise apartments and shopping at corner stores. The tallest apartment building in Topeka has ten stories. Kansans, even urban Kansans, are used to having plenty of space to roam.

**Car ownership**
Almost every senior, adult, teen, and toddler could have a car in Kansas -- in this state, there are 9 cars for every ten residents.

But at one time, trains and transit ruled rural transport on the plains. Between 1870 and 1900, more than 20 different rail transit companies had been established in the Topeka area. Sending trains from Topeka to Kansas City, and Rossville to Eskridge, these private rail companies spanned an exponentially greater network than today's anemic transit services. Today, transit service covers only the city limits, with fewer lines and less frequency than service at the turn of the 20th century.

car ownership https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_U.S._states_by_vehicles_per_capita


To put car ownership in perspective - Kansas is somewhere in the middle. The way we've built our country, car ownership is almost a requirement for getting an education, getting a job, getting to health care, and visiting family and friends. 


It's a complex issue. Our population - and our economy - blew up like a bomb after WWII. We were rich and had a massive population bubble. We built new neighborhoods, new roads, new cities, even - to house all the new people. And new schools, and new fire stations, and new shopping malls. But we didn't build sustainably. We didn't build incrementally. We started to build entire neighborhoods to a finished state - the whole 3-bedroom, 2-bath, 2-car house - was complete, and installed on a cul-de-sac. We wouldn't need sidewalks, because we would always have cars, now that we were wealthy. Plus, the neighborhood was built way outside of town, so each family could have plenty of space for a yard of their own, but that means it's a pretty far drive to get back into town. 

Decades later we realize that the suburbs are the hardest place to make it. Unless you arrive in the suburbs with means, you may never get ahead. The cost of living is high in the suburbs, because the plots are bigger. The cost of transportation is high, because the suburbs are disconnected from the resources in the city. The grocery stores are more expensive, because it costs more to get goods delivered further away. 


**Car-based families, car-less seniors**

And now, in 2020, wages have been depressed for nearly sixty years -- families are struggling to pay for rent, utilities, food, and transportation. Basic travel costs can now account for 20-40% of a family's budget. 

https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/08/07/for-most-us-workers-real-wages-have-barely-budged-for-decades/

The most exciting day in a teenager's life is getting the keys to their first car. No matter how old or rusty the car, it's a great day - it's an emancipation from geographical boundaries imposed by parents. 

Parents are equally excited to hand over the keys. With school a few miles from home and soccer practice 10 miles in a different direction, it's a part-time job just to shuttle kids to their daily activities. As soon as kids can drive themselves, parents start to relax and make their empty-nest plans. 

Americans value solo living above all else. White families in the U.S. rarely live with multiple generations in the home -- usually just parents and children. Rarely grandparents -- they're off in the nursing home, another few miles' drive away, most likely in a suburb without transit access. 

While many of a person's needs can be met at a retirement home, transportation is still a challenge. Because our cities have been designed about car travel by independent drivers, we have eroded the support for good sidewalks, connected communities, and easy-to-use transit. As a result, our seniors are left behind. When elderly people can no longer drive, they mostly stay home.  (need several citations here)

For seniors, transportation is often the biggest cost after housing - outpacing even health care. https://www.forbes.com/sites/josephcoughlin/2019/01/30/the-big-surprising-cost-in-retirement-no-one-plans-for-but-should/?sh=93d2b0d20f32
