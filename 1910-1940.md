## 1910-1940 early days in Topeka ##





The Great Migration was the second, larger wave of black migration from southern states to northern and western states.

**Redlining**

But this was also the time of redlining, when federal officials from the Home Owners' Loan Corporation graded some Topeka neighborhoods as "Hazardous" or "Declining," and discouraged banks from providing loans for any home purchases in those areas. What happened next shouldn't surprise anyone. Investment in those neighborhoods stalled for 80 years. Today, these neighborhoods still suffer from depressed home values and aging infrastructure. 

All of North Topeka, most of central Topeka, and almost all of East Topeka were in the Hazardous or Declining categories in 1940. Just a few neighborhoods in the west and southwest, plus most of the Oakland area, and a small development off 37th Street between Adams and California - were graded either "Still Desirable" or "Best." These auditors shaped the future of Topeka and were one of a dozen factors propelling the population outward. 



Many of the neighborhoods degraded by the HOLC ratings were home to black families, Latino families, other immigrants, and poor white families.

These "hazardous" and "declining" neighborhoods are still struggling today - because of decisions made in the 1930s. In the City of Topeka's Neighborhood Health Map from 2017, all of North Topeka is either "Intensive Care" or "At Risk"; all of downtown is "At Risk"; and central-east Topeka is also "At Risk." These maps are compiled from current data points of poverty, Part I Crimes per 100 persons,  single family homeownership, and boarded houses.

If Topeka, or any North American city, had followed a traditional development pattern throughout the 20th century, we may have seen a slow change in these neighborhoods - even a transition for some of these families out of poverty and into wealth and opportunity. But the baby boom after World War II completely changed the country's white leaders' goals for urban development.

**Black family wealth and its barriers between WWI and WWII**

After emancipation in the 1800s, black Americans started the slow climb toward family wealth. 

Land is one of the most important fixed assets Americans use to accumulate wealth/
But black families were locked out of many opportunities to own. 
And when those opportunities did arise - white Americans did not react from their freedom-loving hearts. They were scared witless. As Antero Pietila recounts in "Not in my Neighborhood," blockbusting was the practice of shrewd real estate agents to buy cheap houses in declining white neighborhoods and sell them above market rate to eager black families chasing the American Dream.  

But federal rules from the HOLC (citation needed) restricted black Americans from buying houses.
Further rules restricted any loans at all from being made for homes in neighborhoods the HOLC deemed "declining" or "hazardous."

At one time, when older neighborhoods meant potential for redevelopment - because of national policy, they now became slums and ghettoes.
