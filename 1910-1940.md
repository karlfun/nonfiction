## 1910-1940 early days in Topeka ##





The Great Migration was the second, larger wave of black migration from southern states to northern and western states.

**Redlining**

But this was also the time of redlining, when federal officials from the Home Owners' Loan Corporation graded some Topeka neighborhoods as "Hazardous" or "Declining," and discouraged banks from providing loans for any home purchases in those areas. What happened next shouldn't surprise anyone. Investment in those neighborhoods stalled for 80 years. Today, these neighborhoods still suffer from depressed home values and aging infrastructure. 

All of North Topeka, most of central Topeka, and almost all of East Topeka were in the Hazardous or Declining categories in 1940. Just a few neighborhoods in the west and southwest, plus most of the Oakland area, and a small development off 37th Street between Adams and California - were graded either "Still Desirable" or "Best." These auditors shaped the future of Topeka and were one of a dozen factors propelling the population outward. 



Many of the neighborhoods degraded by the HOLC ratings were home to black families, Latino families, other immigrants, and poor white families.

These "hazardous" and "declining" neighborhoods are still struggling today - because of decisions made in the 1930s. In the City of Topeka's Neighborhood Health Map from 2017, all of North Topeka is either "Intensive Care" or "At Risk"; all of downtown is "At Risk"; and central-east Topeka is also "At Risk." These maps are compiled from current data points of poverty, Part I Crimes per 100 persons,  single family homeownership, and boarded houses.

If Topeka, or any North American city, had followed a traditional development pattern throughout the 20th century, we may have seen a slow change in these neighborhoods - even a transition for some of these families out of poverty and into wealth and opportunity. But the baby boom after World War II completely changed the country's white leaders' goals for urban development.

**Black family wealth and its barriers between WWI and WWII**

After the civil war and emancipation, black Americans started the slow climb toward family wealth. By moving to safer cities and states, they could start new ventures - farms, families, churches, and businesses. The critical element for independence would be land. This would allow freed people to use their own labor to build their own wealth.

But it wasn't easy.

Northerners may have seen the Civil War as the chance to finally make the South reckon with its problem of people as property. Lincoln issued the Emanicipation Proclamation as a strategic move, hoping to deplete the south of its primary labor force. That document exempts the four states that had not seceded but still allowed for people to be owned as slaves - Missouri, Kentucky, Maryland, and Delaware - so it wasn't truly a national emancipation. Not until the end of the war and the ratification of the 13th Amendment was slavery truly over as a private enterprise.

In another strategic move at the end of the war, northern general William Sherman issued Field Order 15, commandeering 400,000 acres of coastal land from the southern states, from Charleston, South Carolina to St. John's River in Florida, to be given to free black Americans. This move, later known as "40 acres and a mule," had been organized by a group of 20 black ministers from the Savannah, Georgia area, and was seen by the war effort as another way to splinter southern power. Word of the program spread nationally, and by June of 1865, as many as 40,000 Black Americans had moved to the area and claimed their 40-acre plots. 

It was a perfect opportunity: the war was over, slavery was over, and the Union had righted the wrongs of generations of southern slavery. Free people were starting their new lives on their own land, and could work their way into prosperity. 

But it was a short-lived dream. President Andrew Johnson, Lincoln's successor (and a sympathizer with the South), overturned the order in the fall of 1865, and reverted the land back to its original owners.

Land is one of the most important fixed assets Americans use to accumulate wealth.
But black families were locked out of many opportunities to own. 
And when those opportunities did arise - white Americans did not react from their freedom-loving hearts. They were scared witless. As Antero Pietila recounts in "Not in my Neighborhood," blockbusting was the practice of shrewd real estate agents to buy cheap houses in declining white neighborhoods and sell them above market rate to eager black families chasing the American Dream.  

But federal rules from the HOLC (citation needed) restricted black Americans from buying houses.
Further rules restricted any loans at all from being made for homes in neighborhoods the HOLC deemed "declining" or "hazardous."

At one time, when older neighborhoods meant potential for redevelopment - because of national policy, they now became slums and ghettoes.
