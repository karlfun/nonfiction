Many of these news sources became galvanizing political forces, and helped build black support for the Populism movement in Kansas, which seemed to promise the chance to become established community members, deserving of the protection of the law and welcome to the opportunity of commerce. White populists, however, railed against the wealthy and well-bred upper classes. 

"...by 1880 one out of every six persons in greater Topeka and one out of every five persons in greater Kansas City was a Negro."
~15,000 in 1880, 31,000 in 1890 total Topeka population
~2,500 black people in Topeka in 1880.
