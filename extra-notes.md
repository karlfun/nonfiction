Many of these news sources became galvanizing political forces, and helped build black support for the Populism movement in Kansas, which seemed to promise the chance to become established community members, deserving of the protection of the law and welcome to the opportunity of commerce. White populists, however, railed against the wealthy and well-bred upper classes. 

"...by 1880 one out of every six persons in greater Topeka and one out of every five persons in greater Kansas City was a Negro."
~15,000 in 1880, 31,000 in 1890 total Topeka population
~2,500 black people in Topeka in 1880.

**Harlem Renaissance**

After the first World War, there was a time of prosperity in the country. 

Harlem in New York became a global center of black culture. 

Malcolm X arrived in Boston in 1940, at 16 years old.

“I didn’t know the world contained as many Negroes as I saw thronging downtown Roxbury at night, especially on Saturdays,” Malcolm X wrote in his 1964 autobiography, co-authored by Alex Haley. “Neon lights, nightclubs, poolhalls,[cq] bars, the cars they drove! Restaurants made the streets smell-rich, greasy, down-home black cooking. Jukeboxes blared Erskine Hawkins, Duke Ellington, Cootie Williams, dozens of others.”

He then went to Harlem and made all sorts of connections.
