## The early days of Kansas ##


In the current U.S. state of Kansas, we are on occupied land -- land that was once used by the Kickapoo, Kaw/Kansa, Pawnee, Comanche, Oto, Osage, Wichita, Kiowa, Iowa, Escanxaques, and other indigenous communities. Today, descendants of these native tribes live throught the United States, within westernized, colonized communities, including cities like Topeka -- founded by white people but named after indigenous terms-- but also on small, restrictive -- but sovereign -- reservations. Indigenous women are the most at-risk demographic on the entire content, with the widest disparities in health, economics, mortality, and almost all other measures. The results of colonization are still felt viscerally today by indigenous people. For people with native heritage, "freedom" is a loaded word.

"Corps of Discovery" - Lewis and Clark expedition
Lewis and Clark's expedition, the "Corps of Discovery" that led westward through the plains to the coast drew new maps and established trade routes for Americans

...but led to devastation among the native tribes they met. Trade with white people brought disease and devastation to the plains tribes, whether they were nomadic or agricultural, they all suffered.
