## The early days of Kansas ##


In the state of Kansas, we are on occupied land. This is land that was once in use by the Kickapoo, Kaw/Kansa, Pawnee, Comanche, Oto, Osage, Wichita, Kiowa, Iowa, Escanxaques, and other indigenous communities.

Indigenous women are the most at-risk demographic on the entire content, with the widest disparities in health, economics, mortality, and almost all other measures. The results of colonization are still felt viscerally today by indigenous people. For people with native heritage, "freedom" is a loaded word.
