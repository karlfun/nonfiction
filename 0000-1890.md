## The early days of Kansas ##

The land that is known as Kansas was once part of the Louisiana Territory, which the U.S. purchased from France, who purchased it from Spain. But it was never really Spain's or France's land to begin with. The plains were the territory of the Kickapoo, Kaw/Kansa, Pawnee, Comanche, Oto, Osage, Wichita, Kiowa, Iowa, Escanxaques, and other indigenous tribes for hundreds, if not thousands of years before Europeans discovered the continent and started claiming it for themselves. 

Today, descendants of these native tribes live throught the United States, within westernized communities like Topeka -- founded by white people but named after indigenous terms-- but also on small, restrictive -- but sovereign -- reservations. Indigenous women are the most at-risk demographic on the entire content, with the widest disparities in health, economics, mortality, and almost all other measures. The results of colonization are still felt viscerally today by indigenous people, hundreds of years after the firs European settlers landed. For people with native heritage, "freedom" is a loaded word.

Freedom is a heavy word for Black Kansans, too. Even now in 2020, black families face significant economic and health disparities, not only as a result of slavery, but also as a result of the subsequent century of continued oppression toward people of color in the form of Jim Crow laws and 'black codes,' as well as discrimination in housing, employment, education, and health. 

The fight for Kansas to enter the Union as a free state, or a slavery state, was violent and bloody. Slaveowners had financial interests in spreading their insidious practice westward. But abolitionists fought back, and made Kansas free. The fight over slavery had been happening throughout the colonies and carried into the country's westward expansion. The skirmishes in Kansas eventually boiled over into the conflict we call the Civil War. 


Though it ended more than 150 years ago, the Civil War is as relevant as ever. The founding of Kansas as a free-state was the *one of the major reasons* the Civil War started, and yet, Confederate flags can be seen displayed today in Topeka and other parts of the state, on flagpoles, on houses, on the bumpers of cars and the back windows of pickup trucks. 

The story that proud Kansans tell today is that we fought hard to join the Union as a free state. But the truth is not quite so clear. Even at its founding, not every Kansan was against slavery. Of the state's 105 counties, 26 were named for pro-slavery men. The 1855 Territorial Legislature was voted in as a pro-slavery territory. But things had changed by 1859, when the free-state 'Wyandotte Constitution' was passed by referendum, 10,421 to 5,530. Two years later, on January 29, 1861, the state constitution was approved by the U.S. Congress -- but only after Southern legislators had physically walked out of the chamber.

Slavery was such a critical institution in the economy and the way of life in the south that it was a struggle during colonial times for northern colonies to get southern colonies to agree on methods of counting the population and collecting taxes. The colonies which profited most from holding people as property tended to have the most autocratic governments, with the power and control concentrated among just a few wealthy, well-connected members of society. If they didn't count enslaved people as part of their population, they wouldn't have to pay as much in taxes to the central government, so they flat out refused to do so. 

The slavery fight came up again and again as the nation's early leaders emerged, but northern objectionists - hardly impassioned enough to be called abolitionists - could not bring up the issue without causing a rift. We might not have progressed at all in 400 years. 

Even after the Declaration of Independence - supposedly, a time of unity for the fledgling country - the newly-united states all struggled to get on the same page. And as more states joined the Union, factions emerged and the bloody battles for power began. Kansas became a free state only because southern legislators had walked out of congressional session in Washington D.C., and the abolitionist legislators had enough votes to pass the state's constitution. It was a risky move, pulled literally behind the back of some of the country's elected officials. Was war not inevitable in a nation so divided? 






War is a last resort of practical nations, but a natural tendency of human groupthink. Fear is the most powerful human motivator. We fight out of fear, out of a tendency to violently protect our comforts. 

South Carolina voted to secede from the nation shortly after Lincoln's presidential victory. The state built up armories around the military post in Charleston, Fort Sumter, and eventually opened fire upon the fort. Where a developed nation with intelligence networks and well-rounded leaders might have sent a delegation with gifts and a proxy to negotiate - these tools had hardly been developed in the nation's tumultuous first two generations, and the conflict devolved to a military one. 




The symbolism of the Confederate Flag has less to do with the actual Civil War, and more to do with the Lost Cause of the Confederacy. 

"They say that history is written by the victors, but the Civil War has been the rare exception. Perhaps the need for the country to stay together made it necessary for the North to sit silently and accept the South's conception of the conflict. In any case, for most of the past 150 years, the South’s version of the war and Reconstruction has held sway in our schools, our literature and, since the dawn of feature films, our movies."

Missionization


The story of the Mandans wasn't new. White people had been devastating native tribes on the continent for centuries. Some sources even suggest that transmission of viruses like smallpox or other maladies was accidental - since little was understood at that time about viral transmission. 

Europeans and Americans having prolonged interaction with native tribes may have been enough to cause their downfall. In the 1400s, Spanish travelers came through Kansas and found the Etzanoa settlement, which may have been as large as 20,000 people at that time - a community many generations in the making. But 100 years later, when French explorers came through the same area - the settlement was gone. The cause of their demise is currently unknown, but disease, drought, flood, or famine were all possible culprits.

**Socialists in Kansas**


The railroad boom of the late 1800s led to a rush on natural resources - and coal was plentiful in Crawford County, Kansas. Much of the mining activity centered in Girard, with a half-dozen mining concerns operating at one time, employing hundreds of miners, and leading to complementary development in other towns, like Pittsburg, and Joplin, Missouri. 

Because Girard was home to so many laborers, it was a perfect setting for pro-labor philosophy to take hold. Julius Augustus Wayland moved to Girard and founded the socialist newspaper Appeal to Reason in 1897. The newspaper grew to national prominence, featuring writing from Jack London, "Mother" Jones, Upton Sinclair, and Eugene Debs. By 1910, the newspaper had reached a national circulation of more than 500,000 readers every week. 

("In 1904, Appeal to Reason commissioned Upton Sinclair to write a novel about immigrant workers in the Chicago meatpacking houses. Sinclair's novel, titled The Jungle, appeared in 1905 as a serial in Appeal to Reason.")

Life wasn't easy as a socialist publisher. The *Appeal* opposed World War I and the national conscription policy - and as a result, the federal government rescinded its second-class mailing rights. Wayland eventually committed suicide in 1912.

Emanual Julius hoped that inexpensive literature could be made available to the masses. His journalism career brought him to Girard, Kansas, to work for Appeal to Reason. In Girard, Emanuel met Marcet Haldeman, social activist and contemporary of suffragette Jane Addams. Emanuel and Marcet had many shared philosophies, and married in 1916, becoming the Haldeman-Julius family. In 1919, the couple purchased the presses, and most importantly, the national mailing list for the *Appeal*, and in 1919, started publishing what would become the Little Blue Books - notecard-sized pamphlets of history, literature, art, and culture.


By the 1970s, the Haldeman-Julius press had distributed more than 300 million copies of its Little Blue Books.
