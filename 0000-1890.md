## The early days of Kansas ##

The land that is known as Kansas was once part of the Louisiana Territory, which the U.S. purchased from France, who purchased it from Spain. But it was never really Spain's or France's land to begin with. The plains were the territory of the Kickapoo, Kaw/Kansa, Pawnee, Comanche, Oto, Osage, Wichita, Kiowa, Iowa, Escanxaques, and other indigenous tribes for hundreds, if not thousands of years before Europeans discovered the continent and started claiming it for themselves. 

Today, descendants of these native tribes live throught the United States, within westernized communities like Topeka -- founded by white people but named after indigenous terms-- but also on small, restrictive -- but sovereign -- reservations. Indigenous women are the most at-risk demographic on the entire content, with the widest disparities in health, economics, mortality, and almost all other measures. The results of colonization are still felt viscerally today by indigenous people. For people with native heritage, "freedom" is a loaded word.

Freedom is a heavy word for Black Kansans, too. Even now in 2020, black families face significant economic and health disparities, not only as a result of slavery, but also as a result of the subsequent century of continued oppression toward people of color in the form of Jim Crow laws and 'black codes,' as well as discrimination in housing, employment, education, and health. 

The fight for Kansas to enter the Union as a free state, or a slavery state, was violent and bloody. Slaveowners had financial interests in spreading their insidious practice westward. But abolitionists fought back, and made Kansas free. The fight over slavery had been happening throughout the colonies and carried into the country's westward expansion. The skirmishes in Kansas eventually boiled over into the conflict we call the Civil War. 






Many events set Kansas on its current path. This book will consider elements of a few of those major events: The Reconstruction era and the Exodusters, and the baby boom after World War II.......

"Corps of Discovery" - Lewis and Clark expedition
Lewis and Clark's military expedition, the "Corps of Discovery" led westward through the plains to the coast through the country's newly-acquired Louisiana Territory. Barely two decades old, the country more than doubled its size. President Thomas Jefferson, who made the gamble on the Louisiana Purchase, 




...but led to devastation among the native tribes they met. Trade with white people brought disease and devastation to the plains tribes, whether they were nomadic or agricultural, they all suffered.

Missionization


The story of the Mandans wasn't new. White people had been devastating native tribes on the continent for centuries. Some sources even suggest that transmission of viruses like smallpox or other maladies was accidental - since little was understood at that time about viral transmission. 

Europeans and Americans having prolonged interaction with native tribes may have been enough to cause their downfall. In the 1400s, Spanish travelers came through Kansas and found the Etzanoa settlement, which may have been as large as 20,000 people at that time - a community many generations in the making. But 100 years later, when French explorers came through the same area - the settlement was gone. The cause of their demise is currently unknown, but disease, drought, flood, or famine were all possible culprits.
