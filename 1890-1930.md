## 1890 - 1930: Exodusters from Tennessee, Lytle Family in Topeka, black establishments in Topeka and Kansas, National Negro Business League ##



**The Lytle Family**

The Lytle Family
One Exoduster, John Lytle, born into slavery but freed by the 13th amendment, was a barber and later a salesman in Murfreesboro, Tennessee. Though he and his family were free, they had limited opportunities for land, worship, and education in Tennessee. Reconstruction had failed to deliver the equality it promised, and in fact, local and national racist policymaking, as well as outright mob violence — escalated in the 1870s, especially in Tennessee.

In 1882, John and Mary Ann Lytle heard the call of the Exodusters, and uprooted their family of five from Tennessee and moved to Kansas. In Topeka, John established a barbershop at 207 S. Kansas Avenue. He went on to serve on the city’s police force, and was politically active in the state’s Populist Party.

The Lytles’ children were successful, too.

Crediting her experience working for newspapers and for the Legislature in Topeka, the Lytles’ daughter, Lutie Lytle, was the first black woman in the U.S. to become a law professor.

Their son Charles also went into barbering and law enforcement like his father, but became better known as the owner of Lytle’s Drug Store at 112 SE 4th Street. (https://ilr.law.uiowa.edu/print/volume-102-issue-5/i-shall-talk-to-my-own-people-the-intersectional-life-and-times-of-lutie-a-lytle)

By 1956, the Lytle family had grown to almost 20 members in Topeka, even with Lutie and her family settling elsewhere. Lytle’s Barber Shop was even listed in the Green Book entry for Topeka (https://www.cjonline.com/news/20190306/history-guy-green-books-suggest-topeka-was-more-welcoming-to-african-americans-than-other-kansas-cities) at that time. Though John had passed away in 1933, by all measures he had established a successful and comfortable home for his family in Topeka.

In 1958, Lytle’s Drug Store, as well as Velvet Freeze restaurant, La Michoacana Tortilleria, Star Lounge, the Apex Theater, and dozens of other businesses and residences were closed and vacated in order to clear the land for urban renewal.

The demolition crews came and went, leaving bare earth in their path.

Ten years later, in 1966, not a single Lytle remained in Topeka.

The departure of the Lytle family is a tiny example of the unfathomable loss caused by urban renewal.

**Redlining**

But this was also the time of redlining, when federal officials from the Home Owners' Loan Corporation graded some Topeka neighborhoods as "Hazardous" or "Declining," and discouraged banks from providing loans for any home purchases in those areas. What happened next shouldn't surprise anyone. Investment in those neighborhoods stalled for 80 years. Today, these neighborhoods still suffer from depressed home values and aging infrastructure. 

All of North Topeka, most of central Topeka, and almost all of East Topeka were in the Hazardous or Declining categories in 1940. Just a few neighborhoods in the west and southwest, plus most of the Oakland area, and a small development off 37th Street between Adams and California - were graded either "Still Desirable" or "Best." These auditors shaped the future of Topeka and were one of a dozen factors propelling the population outward. 



Many of the neighborhoods degraded by the HOLC ratings were home to black families, Latino families, other immigrants, and poor white families.
