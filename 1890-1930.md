## 1890 - 1930: Exodusters from Tennessee, Lytle Family in Topeka, black establishments in Topeka and Kansas, National Negro Business League ##



While the South was fighting in the Civil War for 'States' Rights,' the rights they were referring to were to keep people as property. And as soon as the war was over, and Lincoln had been assassinated, southern states quickly set to work enforcing their 'states' rights' again, writing new laws restricting the movement of the newly-freed black people in their midsts. As early as 1865, the year the war ended, "black codes" were being written and enacted.

Exodus of free black families to Kansas, Nebraska, Oklahoma, and Colorado -- as a result of the (mixed) opportunity of the Homestead Act, new railroad lines making migration possible, and the new rights granted by the Reconstruction amendments. 
Farming the prairie was rarely a profitable prospect. The exodusters who had the best success were the ones who moved to cities and towns, where they established new businesses, joined church communities, and found work for family members.

Kansas was particularly appealing to newly freed black people, as the state became known for its abolition efforts by John Brown and others. 

The exodusters were not a monolith; some of the black Americans moving west had almost no money and possessions, while some groups had resources for farming and establishing other types of businesses. Settlements like Nicodemus sought to attract people with resources and funds to develop the town and discouraged the influx of poor migrants.

In places like Topeka, people without many physical assets soon found themselves with the valuable resource of a new network — a burgeoning black community. By 1907, Topeka had 71 churches, 29 of which were home to black congregations. 








**The Lytle Family**

The Lytle Family
One Exoduster, John Lytle, born into slavery but freed by the 13th amendment, was a barber and later a salesman in Murfreesboro, Tennessee. Though he and his family were free, they had limited opportunities for land, worship, and education in Tennessee. Reconstruction had failed to deliver the equality it promised, and in fact, local and national racist policymaking, as well as outright mob violence — escalated in the 1870s, especially in Tennessee.

In 1882, John and Mary Ann Lytle heard the call of the Exodusters, and uprooted their family of five from Tennessee and moved to Kansas. In Topeka, John established a barbershop at 207 S. Kansas Avenue. He went on to serve on the city’s police force, and was politically active in the state’s Populist Party.

The Lytles’ children were successful, too.

Crediting her experience working for newspapers and for the Legislature in Topeka, the Lytles’ daughter, Lutie Lytle, was the first black woman in the U.S. to become a law professor.

Their son Charles also went into barbering and law enforcement like his father, but became better known as the owner of Lytle’s Drug Store at 112 SE 4th Street. (https://ilr.law.uiowa.edu/print/volume-102-issue-5/i-shall-talk-to-my-own-people-the-intersectional-life-and-times-of-lutie-a-lytle)

By 1956, the Lytle family had grown to almost 20 members in Topeka, even with Lutie and her family settling elsewhere. Lytle’s Barber Shop was even listed in the Green Book entry for Topeka (https://www.cjonline.com/news/20190306/history-guy-green-books-suggest-topeka-was-more-welcoming-to-african-americans-than-other-kansas-cities) at that time. Though John had passed away in 1933, by all measures he had established a successful and comfortable home for his family in Topeka.

In 1958, Lytle’s Drug Store, as well as Velvet Freeze restaurant, La Michoacana Tortilleria, Star Lounge, the Apex Theater, and dozens of other businesses and residences were closed and vacated in order to clear the land for urban renewal.

The demolition crews came and went, leaving bare earth in their path.

Ten years later, in 1966, not a single Lytle remained in Topeka.

The departure of the Lytle family is a tiny example of the unfathomable loss caused by urban renewal.

**Legislative War of 1912**

Populist uprising

Many free black people in Kansas established newspapers. Many of these news sources became galvanizing political forces, and helped build black support for the Populism movement in Kansas, which seemed to promise the chance to become established community members, deserving of the protection of the law and welcome to the opportunity of commerce. White populists, however, railed against the wealthy and well-bred upper classes. 

"...by 1880 one out of every six persons in greater Topeka and one out of every five persons in greater Kansas City was a Negro."
~15,000 in 1880, 31,000 in 1890 total Topeka population
~2,500 black people in Topeka in 1880.

**Redlining**

But this was also the time of redlining, when federal officials from the Home Owners' Loan Corporation graded some Topeka neighborhoods as "Hazardous" or "Declining," and discouraged banks from providing loans for any home purchases in those areas. What happened next shouldn't surprise anyone. Investment in those neighborhoods stalled for 80 years. Today, these neighborhoods still suffer from depressed home values and aging infrastructure. 

All of North Topeka, most of central Topeka, and almost all of East Topeka were in the Hazardous or Declining categories in 1940. Just a few neighborhoods in the west and southwest, plus most of the Oakland area, and a small development off 37th Street between Adams and California - were graded either "Still Desirable" or "Best." These auditors shaped the future of Topeka and were one of a dozen factors propelling the population outward. 



Many of the neighborhoods degraded by the HOLC ratings were home to black families, Latino families, other immigrants, and poor white families.
