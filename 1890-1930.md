**Redlining**

But this was also the time of redlining, when federal officials from the Home Owners' Loan Corporation graded some Topeka neighborhoods as "Hazardous" or "Declining," and discouraged banks from providing loans for any home purchases in those areas. What happened next shouldn't surprise anyone. Investment in those neighborhoods stalled for 80 years. Today, these neighborhoods still suffer from depressed home values and aging infrastructure. 

All of North Topeka, most of central Topeka, and almost all of East Topeka were in the Hazardous or Declining categories in 1940. Just a few neighborhoods in the west and southwest, plus most of the Oakland area, and a small development off 37th Street between Adams and California - were graded either "Still Desirable" or "Best." These auditors shaped the future of Topeka and were one of a dozen factors propelling the population outward. 



Many of the neighborhoods degraded by the HOLC ratings were home to black families, Latino families, other immigrants, and poor white families.
