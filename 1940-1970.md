**Urban Renewal in Topeka**


In the 1950s and 1960s, more than 3,000 Topekans were forced to leave their homes and businesses in The Bottoms district in downtown to make way for new real estate development and the construction of Interstate 70, all as part of the Keyway Urban Renewal Project. (https://crcnet.org/crc-history/)

The country was at the peak of the Baby Boom, when all roads seemed to lead to prosperity. Topeka’s population was growing rapidly, construction was constant, and no one could predict an end to the wave of economic success brought by the post-war population explosion.

The Housing Act of 1954 opened up a huge federal grant program for cities to rebuild their downtowns. Two years later, President Eisenhower signed the Federal Aid Highway Act of 1956. Millions of dollars in economic development money were made available to every city with a plan. So, Topeka made a plan.

Topeka’s Urban Renewal Agency conceived and oversaw the “Keyway” project, which would eradicate so-called slums in the downtown area and clear lots for new retail and light-industrial development. Instead, the program decimated a neighborhood called The Bottoms — more than 20 blocks of residences and businesses, and decades of Topeka’s history. *(Urban Renewal file, Topeka Room, Topeka and Shawnee County Public Library; press clippings)*

East 4th Street in the Bottoms was the heart of a thriving Black Business District, with more than 50 different businesses: doctors, lawyers, dentists, bars, restaurants, cafes, community cornerstones like Lytle’s Drug Store, as well as shops, nightclubs, and the beloved Apex Theater.

The Bottoms district also hosted a robust and connected Latino community, with strong ties to Topeka’s Oakland neighborhood and Our Lady of Guadelupe Parish.

This area’s history is inextricably linked with Topeka’s history. Many of Topeka’s Latin-American immigrants came to Topeka to work for the railroad; and African-Americans came to Topeka looking for a new start.

Cyrus Holliday founded Topeka, brought the railroad, and with it, economic development and jobs. But it was the influx of free Black Americans and immigrants who truly put Topeka on the map. After the end of the Civil War, thousands of free Black families moved from the eastern U.S. to Kansas to start new lives, later known as Exodusters. 

In the 1880s, about 20% of the Topeka population was comprised of Black Americans, or about 2,500 of its 15,000 total population. (Today that proportion is less than 10%)

By 1906 in Topeka, 28 of the city’s 71 churches were Black congregations. Black families in Topeka settled in Tennessee Town (many Exodusters were from Tennessee), in Mudtown just south of the downtown area, in Redmonsville in North Topeka, and also in The Bottoms. In 1907, Topeka hosted the 8th annual meeting of the National Negro Business League, Booker T. Washington’s organization built to support black business and entrepreneurship across the country. *(National Negro Business League, 1906 City Directory, Topeka, KS (Topeka Room, TSCPL))*

Black families built their own networks in Topeka, including newspapers and other publications and periodicals, social groups, non-profits, and political parties.

**Urban Renewal pushed people out.**

If you were lucky enough to own property in the Keyway area, the program would buy your property as compensation for your loss. Some residents found new homes in the Oakland and Highland Park neighborhoods. But if you were renting — many black families and immigrant families were prohibited from securing loans or buying property due to redlining — the Urban Renewal Agency offered no compensation or relocation assistance.

Today in 2020, The Bottoms district is more vacant and less diverse than it ever was, though there are still a few streets full of 100-year old homes. A two-story, two-bedroom house in the area sold in 2016 for $5,000. *(Shawnee County Appraiser, Property Record for 221 SW Harrison St.)* 

Urban Renewal ultimately banished poor people from downtown, built highways for the affluent to avoid the area entirely, and deeply depressed the housing prices in the central business district. 

In the 1960s, classic buildings from the late 1800s were bulldozed in the Bottoms to build new development. One such project along southeast 4th Street was a Montgomery-Ward department store and massive surface parking lot. In spite of the stated intentions of urban renewal — to keep downtown relevant to suburban residents — the department store left the downtown area after two decades, to move into the mall on the edge of the city. After an extended period of vacancy, the old Montgomery Ward building was eventually repurposed into the Law Enforcement Center. Yes, the police station sits in the middle of the former Black Business District. And the city can no longer collect property tax from that parcel.

The written intentions of urban renewal may have been noble. But its effects caused long lasting economic and social devastation. The program failed categorically to enrich cities, but had a spectacular record of reinforcing stereotypes, forcing black people and immigrants out of opportunity, and breaking up families and social networks.

**What is a slum?**

Lyndon Johnson's "War on Poverty" started in 1964, mostly because of the work of civil rights activists. If members of the civil rights movement hadn't banded together across racial divides to tackle larger problems - like poverty - the white moderate might never have considered taking up the challenge. 

the problem of "slums" in cities hadn't been real to many white decision-makers in the prior decades. Immigrant families and black families knew the treachery of slumlords, disinvested neighborhoods, and discrimination on all fronts - but until the housing studies of the 1940s and 1950s were conducted (in order to make government plans for urban renewal projects), these problems were rarely documented or catalogued. Finally, in the era of the Civil Rights Act, when black people were put on "equal" footing with white people, the problem of poverty (which affects all races, but some disproportionately) could be called a scourge publically, and addressed politically. 

Later in the decade, The Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and other leaders in the Souther Christian Leadership Conference recognized the class solidarity that poor black people had with poor white people, and others, and organized the Poor People's Campaign and the Poor People's March on Washington. Now that poverty had been revealed to be a national problem, and not just a personal failure, the movement gained momentum. Activists could hold leaders accountable - and in some cases, at least, affect positive change for communities, with both disenfranchised people and the upper classes of people "feeling good" about these changes.

" McKnight, Last Crusade (1998), pp. 13–14: "King's emergent radicalism was fostered by his mounting despair over the callous and reactionary political climate in Washington. The White House's earlier boastful assurances of 'guns and butter' was proving a cruel hoax. Johnson's 1966 civil rights bill containing the strong open housing title died in the Senate, largely because the White House, distracted by the Vietnam War, never bothered to lobby the leaders of the political opposition in the upper house. Before the year ended the Congress slashed the budget of the Office of Economic Opportunity, reducing the War on Poverty funds by half a billion dollars ...""

The progress was unfortunately short-lived. By 1967, the budget for the Office of Economic Opportunity had been dramatically cut back. 

What lifts people out of poverty? Family stability, opportunities in education, access to health care, stable employment, and opportunities for advancement and to set goals, like training, raises, degrees, and certifications. What American institutions have been significantly threatened in the intervening decades since the so-called War on Poverty? Families, education, health care, employment, and opportunity.

We have the research that demonstrates what works. 

And we have the tangled web of non-profits desperately trying to keep people afloat in an ocean of need.

Some communities have almost eliminated poverty. Our federal government could do more, if we didn't abdicate the responsibility for our foundational institutions to private industry and the free market. 

The free market won't solve for stable employment. For every Henry Ford, who paid his employees double the average wages in 1913, there is a Jeff Bezos, whose workforce is one of the highest consumers of welfare benefits in the country.

Another program that works: give people the money they need.

**The death of American manufacturing**

In the years after urban renewal remixed city centers, banished black Americans from downtowns, and bulldozed factories to build shiny new retail - mega-corporations in the U.S. started to realize the profit potential in moving their manufacturing overseas, in countries where labor was less organized, and significantly cheaper. Before World War II, corporations took pride in American manufacturing. The 1950s were the peak of union membership in the country. In 1955, one in five Kansans belonged to a Union; nationally, the average was even higher. But as Unions grew in membership and strength, business owners sought other means to profits. 

Soon, CEOs and shareholders began to retreat from the power of unions. If American labor came at a high price, these companies would find workers elsewhere. In the 1970s, Jack Welch, CEO of General Electric, argued that corporations owe their first allegiance to stockholders -- not employees. And so, the barons of industry fell back on the American tradition of labor exploitation. Once it was slavery; now it's offshoring. Recently, when the average American manufacturing worker was making $14 an hour, the average manufacturing worker in China was making about 57 cents per hour. 

But that's talking about free people. The 13th amendment to the U.S. constitution prohibits slavery *except as punishment for a crime.* Slavery is still legal in the United States, and it is codified into the prison system. During wildfires along the west coast in 2020, inmates from California prisons were "allowed" to risk their lives fighting fires and clearing brush for the distinct privilege of earning about $1 an hour.

The 1970s brought the nation's first taste of struggle after its decades of plenty following WWII. Unemployment rose, inflation rose, and international oil prices were raised. The country wasn't used to things slowing down. This was a shock on multiple fronts. The federal government tried a number of tactics to right the ship, but ultimately only mellowed the blow.

**The Myth of Meritocracy**

I grew up learning about the Civil Rights Movement and all of the progress that our society had made together. My hometown was the setting for the Brown v. Board case that desegregated schools - and I was living that history, sitting in classrooms in the first million-dollar high school west of the Mississippi, known for its academics and its diversity. 

By the time I studied U.S. history in high school, I was pretty sure we had all solved racism together. I argued against affirmative action in debate class, positing that the "meritocracy" should let the most "deserving" students rise to the top.

But I may have been sheltered by my education. Because of my performance in school, I was encouraged to take honors and "advanced placement" (AP) classes. While black and Latino students make up 37% of high school students, they make up only 27% of students taking AP classes. 

And that meritocracy I gave speeches about? It doesn't exist. If life achievements were based on merit alone, then our zip codes wouldn't be tied to life expectancy.

One of the biggest determining factors in a child's aptitude for success is their environment. Children growing up in poverty are more likely to become teen parents, become incarcerated, and tend to earn less as adults. https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2019/05/harvard-study-shows-exactly-how-poverty-impacts-childrens-success/

We might not agree on what constitutes success, or what it looks like to achive the modern-day "American Dream." But most Americans agree that education is a liberating factor. Providing a strong foundation can bolster any child, and provide opportunity for dreaming up a future.

But there is work to do to make sure that everyone is on equal footing to go out and grab that American Dream.
