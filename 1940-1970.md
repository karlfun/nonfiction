**Urban Renewal in Topeka**


In the 1950s and 1960s, more than 3,000 Topekans were forced to leave their homes and businesses in The Bottoms district in downtown to make way for new real estate development and the construction of Interstate 70, all as part of the Keyway Urban Renewal Project. (https://crcnet.org/crc-history/)

The country was at the peak of the Baby Boom, when all roads seemed to lead to prosperity. Topeka’s population was growing rapidly, construction was constant, and no one could predict an end to the wave of economic success brought by the post-war population explosion.

The Housing Act of 1954 opened up a huge federal grant program for cities to rebuild their downtowns. Two years later, President Eisenhower signed the Federal Aid Highway Act of 1956. Millions of dollars in economic development money were made available to every city with a plan. So, Topeka made a plan.

Topeka’s Urban Renewal Agency conceived and oversaw the “Keyway” project, which would eradicate so-called slums in the downtown area and clear lots for new retail and light-industrial development. Instead, the program decimated a neighborhood called The Bottoms — more than 20 blocks of residences and businesses, and decades of Topeka’s history. *(Urban Renewal file, Topeka Room, Topeka and Shawnee County Public Library; press clippings)*

East 4th Street in the Bottoms was the heart of a thriving Black Business District, with more than 50 different businesses: doctors, lawyers, dentists, bars, restaurants, cafes, community cornerstones like Lytle’s Drug Store, as well as shops, nightclubs, and the beloved Apex Theater.

The Bottoms district also hosted a robust and connected Latino community, with strong ties to Topeka’s Oakland neighborhood and Our Lady of Guadelupe Parish.

This area’s history is inextricably linked with Topeka’s history. Many of Topeka’s Latin-American immigrants came to Topeka to work for the railroad; and African-Americans came to Topeka looking for a new start.

Cyrus Holliday founded Topeka, brought the railroad, and with it, economic development and jobs. But it was the influx of free Black Americans and immigrants who truly put Topeka on the map. After the end of the Civil War, thousands of free Black families moved from the eastern U.S. to Kansas to start new lives, later known as Exodusters. 

In the 1880s, about 20% of the Topeka population was comprised of Black Americans, or about 2,500 of its 15,000 total population. (Today that proportion is less than 10%)

By 1906 in Topeka, 28 of the city’s 71 churches were Black congregations. Black families in Topeka settled in Tennessee Town (many Exodusters were from Tennessee), in Mudtown just south of the downtown area, in Redmonsville in North Topeka, and also in The Bottoms. In 1907, Topeka hosted the 8th annual meeting of the National Negro Business League, Booker T. Washington’s organization built to support black business and entrepreneurship across the country. *(National Negro Business League, 1906 City Directory, Topeka, KS (Topeka Room, TSCPL))*

Black families built their own networks in Topeka, including newspapers and other publications and periodicals, social groups, non-profits, and political parties.

If you were lucky enough to own property in the Keyway area, the program would buy your property as compensation for your loss. Some residents found new homes in the Oakland and Highland Park neighborhoods. But if you were renting — many black families and immigrant families were prohibited from securing loans or buying property due to redlining — the Urban Renewal Agency offered no compensation or relocation assistance.

Today in 2020, The Bottoms district is more vacant and less diverse than it ever was, and the poverty in Topeka is deeper and more pronounced than it was in the “slums” of the 1950s.

There are a handful of houses on the fringes of the district. One two-story, two-bedroom house in the area sold in 2016 for $5,000. *(Shawnee County Appraiser, Property Record for 221 SW Harrison St.)*

Urban Renewal ultimately banished poor people from downtown, built highways for wealthy people to avoid the area entirely, and deeply depressed the housing prices in the central business district. 

In the 1960s, classic buildings from the late 1800s were bulldozed to build a Montgomery-Ward department store and massive surface parking lot. In spite of the stated intentions of urban renewal — to keep downtown relevant to suburban residents — the department store left the downtown area after two decades, to move into the mall on the edge of the city. After an extended period of vacancy, the building was eventually repurposed into the Law Enforcement Center. Yes, the police station sits in the middle of the former Black Business District. And the city can no longer collect property tax from that parcel.

The written intentions of urban renewal may have been noble. But its effects caused long lasting economic and social devastation. The program failed categorically to enrich cities, but had a spectacular record of reinforcing stereotypes, forcing black people and immigrants out of opportunity, and breaking up families and social networks. 


-------------------

Lyndon Johnson's "War on Poverty" started in 1964 because the problem of "slums" in cities hadn't been real to many white decision-makers in the prior decades. Immigrant families and black families knew the treachery of slumlords, disinvested neighborhoods, and discrimination on all fronts - but until the housing studies of the 1940s and 1950s were conducted (in order to make government plans for urban renewal projects), these problems were rarely documented or catalogued. Finally, in the era of the Civil Rights Act, when black people were put on "equal" footing with white people, the problem of poverty (which affects all races, but some disproportionately) could be called a scourge, and addressed. 

Later in the decade, The Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and other leaders in the Souther Christian Leadership Conference recognized the class solidarity that poor black people had with poor white people, and others, and organized the Poor People's Campaign and the Poor People's March on Washington. Now that poverty had been revealed to be a national problem, and not just a personal failure, the movement gained momentum. Activists could hold leaders accountable - and in some cases, at least, affect positive change for communities, with both disenfranchised people and the upper classes of people "feeling good" about these changes.

" McKnight, Last Crusade (1998), pp. 13–14: "King's emergent radicalism was fostered by his mounting despair over the callous and reactionary political climate in Washington. The White House's earlier boastful assurances of 'guns and butter' was proving a cruel hoax. Johnson's 1966 civil rights bill containing the strong open housing title died in the Senate, largely because the White House, distracted by the Vietnam War, never bothered to lobby the leaders of the political opposition in the upper house. Before the year ended the Congress slashed the budget of the Office of Economic Opportunity, reducing the War on Poverty funds by half a billion dollars ...""

In the years after urban renewal remixed city centers, banished black Americans from downtowns, and bulldozed factories to build shiny new retail - mega-corporations in the U.S. started to realize the profit potential in moving their manufacturing overseas, in countries where labor was less organized, and significantly cheaper. Before World War II, corporations took pride in American manufacturing. The 1950s were the peak of union membership in the country. In 1955, one in five Kansans belonged to a Union; nationally, the average was even higher. But as Unions grew in membership and strength, business owners sought other means to profits. 

Soon, CEOs and shareholders began to retreat from the power of unions. If American labor came at a high price, these companies would find workers elsewhere. In the 1970s, Jack Welch, CEO of General Electric, argued that corporations owe their first allegiance to stockholders -- not employees. And so, the barons of industry fell back on the American tradition of labor exploitation. Once it was slavery; now it's offshoring. Recently, when the average American manufacturing worker was making $14 an hour, the average manufacturing worker in China was making about 57 cents per hour. 

But that's talking about free people. The 13th amendment to the U.S. constitution prohibits slavery *except as punishment for a crime.* Slavery is still legal in the United States, and it is codified in the prison system. During wildfires along the west coast in 2020, inmates from California prisons were allowed to risk their lives fighting fires and clearing brush for around $1 an hour.
