1. Introduction
1. Setup: Local => National. My hometown, Topeka, Kansas, has all the same problems of our country's rural communities and our biggest cities. Every big mistake we've made has compounded into real problems for people in Topeka, New York, Los Angeles, and everywhere else. 






Since the end of the Civil War, black Americans have been promised opportunity, only to have that opportunity swiftly revoked. There have been three major waves of this back-and-forth giving and taking of freedom since the mid-1800s, and they all have long-lasting effects which have affected black wealth and opportunity throughout history and up to the present moment. 



1. Lytle family in Tennessee - missed out on 40 acres

After the Civil War, the Lytle family were legally liberated. The former slaves were living in Murfreesboro, Tennessee. Even after the promise of "40 acres and a mule" had dissolved, the Lytles were still looking for opportunity, looking for their chance to start their new lives. 

That would not be in Tennessee.
